Project: Creating a recipe website

The goal of this project was to consolidate basic html skills and to get a grasp on how git/github works.

I was able to successfully use HTML without any issues.

I realised as I finished the project that I wasn't using git properly. I had forgotten to save changes before commit to git. Lesson learned.
