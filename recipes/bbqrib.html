        <p><em>A homemade recipe that's so easy and quick to make</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>This WAS an easy and quick recipe for your basic lasagna, HOWEVER, I did alter it a bit! :) I added chopped onion and 3 cloves minced fresh garlic to the ground beef while it was browning, along with a teaspoon or so of Paula Deen's House Seasoning (Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt and pepper would work, too). </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>½ large onion, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>
            <li>¼ cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
            <li>3 pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken, cut 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick across bones)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour soy sauce, water, vinegar, and sesame oil into a large, non-metallic bowl. Whisk in onion, garlic, brown sugar, white sugar, and pepper, whisking until sugars dissolve. Submerge ribs in the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate 7 to 12 hours; the longer, the better.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Remove ribs from marinade and shake off excess; discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes per side.</li>
        </ol>
