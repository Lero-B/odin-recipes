        <p><em>A homemade recipe that's so easy and quick to make</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>This WAS an easy and quick recipe for your basic lasagna, HOWEVER, I did alter it a bit! :) I added chopped onion and 3 cloves minced fresh garlic to the ground beef while it was browning, along with a teaspoon or so of Paula Deen's House Seasoning (Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt and pepper would work, too). </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup reduced-fat sour cream (such as Daisy®)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</li>
            <li>3 cucumbers, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced crosswise</li>
            <li>½ cup thinly sliced red onion</li>
            <li>coarse salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix sour cream, lemon juice, and dill together in a bowl. Add cucumbers and onion; stir to combine. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        </ol>
